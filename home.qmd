### Part technical 👨🏻‍💻 + Part creative 👨🏻‍🎨 + Part strategic 👨🏻‍🚀

I use data to fix systems that don't work for everyone and shape policies that reflect the messy, diverse, beautiful realities of human lives.

Whether I am working in government, consulting, or research, I thrive at the intersection of curiosity, rigour, and purpose. I lead multidisciplinary teams, build decision tools, and solve wicked problems by connecting dots across disciplines and sectors. I am big on inclusive design, visual metaphors, and working with people who care as deeply as I do.

And yes, I still find time for boxing, mentoring, and the occasional data memes!
