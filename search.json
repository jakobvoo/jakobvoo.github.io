I lead multidisciplinary teams, build decision tools, and solve wicked problems by connecting dots across disciplines and sectors. I am big on inclusive design, visual metaphors, and working with people who care as deeply as I do.\nAnd yes, I still find time for boxing, mentoring, and the occasional data memes!"
